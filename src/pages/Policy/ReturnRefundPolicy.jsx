          Return & Refund Policy
        </h1>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          The Return and Refund Policy informs customers of the terms under which they can return a
          product or request a refund. This is especially important for e-commerce websites or
          service-based platforms.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          Your policy should cover:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800">
          <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> What products or services are eligible for return?</li>
          <li><strong>Time Frame:</strong> How many days do customers have to request a return or refund (e.g., within 7 or 14 days)?</li>
          <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Must the product be unused, in original packaging, or in a certain condition?</li>
          <li><strong>Process:</strong> How to request a returnâ€”should the customer contact support, fill out a form, or return to a location?</li>
          <li><strong>Refund Method:</strong> Will refunds be given via original payment method, store credit, or replacement?</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Having a clear Return/Refund Policy improves customer confidence and reduces disputes.
        </p>

          For physical products, items must be returned in their original condition and packaging.
